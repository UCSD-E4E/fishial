This repository presents python scripts for training neural networks using the Detectron 2 framework, as well as scripts for working with OIV6 datasets and any others.

  - Train NN model using script jupyter notebook or using .py scripts 
  - Preprocessing OIV6 
  - Ð¡reation of a dataset in semi-automatic mode

## Installation

Install the dependencies.

```sh
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


## Train

1. in the **train** folder you can find the train.py file in order to start the training on your own dataset change the path at the beginning of the script
2. use file **Detectron2_Fishial_train.ipynb** follow the instructions in the script
